    "    standard Python functions or custom functions/classes, or can be a external REST API (the special `$remote` class).\n",
    "* Router: A special type of step is a router with routing logic and multiple child routes/models. The basic \n",
    "    routing logic is to route to the child routes based on the `event.path`. More advanced or custom routing can be used,\n",
    "    for example, the ensemble router sends the event to all child routes in parallel, aggregates the result and responds.\n",
    "* Queue: A queue or stream that accepts data from one or more source steps and publishes to one or more output steps. \n",
